# Find Pi

Question: Can we determine the value of Pi through data points of a circle?

Solution: Yes. There are several ways to sovle pi. This method is by using a certain number of data points from (0, 1) and a circle. which we find the amount of data points within the circle and the total amount of data points.

Note: This will not always be the most accurate since it uses a random set of data points everytime.
